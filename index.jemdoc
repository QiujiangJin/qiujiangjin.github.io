== About me

I am a Ph.D. student from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering of University of Texas at Austin]. I'm advised by [https://sites.utexas.edu/mokhtari/ Aryan Mokhtari]. My research interests generally lie in the theory and applications of continuous optimization algorithms. My current research focuses on the design and analysis of numerical optimization methods for large-scale machine learning problems.
