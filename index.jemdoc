== About me

I am a Ph.D. student at the [https://www.oden.utexas.edu/ Oden Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences] of [https://www.utexas.edu/ University of Texas at Austin]. I'm also a member of the [http://wncg.ord Wireless Networking and Communications Group]. I'm advised by [https://sites.utexas.edu/mokhtari/ Prof. Aryan Mokhtari]. I received my B.Sc. in pure and applied mathematics  from the [https://www.math.tsinghua.edu.cn/ Department of Mathematical Sciences] at [https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/ Tsinghua University] in 2015 and my M.Sc. in computational and mathematical engineering from the [https://icme.stanford.edu/ Institute for Computational & Mathematical Engineering] at [https://www.stanford.edu/ Stanford University] in 2017. My research interests generally lie in the theory and applications of optimization. My current research focuses on the development of efficient second-order numerical optimization methods for large-scale machine learning problems.
